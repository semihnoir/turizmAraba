The Sumela Monastery in Trabzon, the tea fields of Rize and the natural wonders of Artvin are some of the most special places in the Black Sea. The Black Sea fascinates with its plateaus and peaceful atmosphere.

We head towards Eastern Anatolia. This region, which hosts the highest mountains and harshest winters in Turkey, is like a paradise for nature lovers.
